            	<b>1. Faculty Introduction</b>
                <br>
Faculty of Chemical Engineering consists of three Departments (Department of Chemical Engineering, Department of Environmental Engineering and Department of Pharmaceutical Engineering). There are 3 specialties for undergraduate students: Chemical Engineering and technology, Environmental Engineering and Pharmaceutical Engineering, in which Chemical Engineering and Technology has been selected into ‘A Plan for Educating and Training Outstanding Engineers (PETOE)’ undertaken by Ministry of Education of China and approved to be provincial excellent specialty. The faculty has been approved to be first-level provincial key construction discipline and authorized to offer Master Degree of Engineering in the discipline of ‘Chemical engineering’. The faculty has 1 jiangsu provincial training center of Salt chemical engineering and 5 laboratories for teaching of Analysis and testing center, they are Basic chemistry, Chemical engineering, Environmental engineering, Pharmaceutical engineering. The laboratories cover an area about 12000 ㎡ and the equipments worth 30 million yuan. The faculty also has 18 teaching practice base inside and outside the institute.</br>

The Faculty has 2 provincial key laboratories: Key Laboratory for Palygorskite Science and Applied Technology of Jiangsu province and Jiangsu Provincial Engineering Laboratory for Advanced Materials of Salt Chemical Industry.
The  Key Laboratory for Palygorskite Science and Applied Technology of Jiangsu province (PSAT) was established in 2008 approved by Science and Technology Department of Jiangsu Province, which is a basic application research platform of HYIT for development and utilization of the  local abundant mineral resources called palygorskite (also known as Attapulgite). There are 37 members in the laboratory, among whom there is 1 with ‘National Outstanding Youth’, 4 in provincial outstanding discipline and 5 candidates for provincial “Six kinds of Top Talents”. Since 2008, the PSAT already invested about 25 million in the state-of-the-art instruments, including SEM, Powder XRD, Laser Confocal Raman Microspectrometer, X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometer and etc. As the only palygorskite research laboratory in china, the mission of PSAT is to conduct fundamental research of palygorskite targeted at solving challenges of industrial interest. There are mainly three research orientations under developing: (1) Dissociation of palygorskite crystal bundles to nanomaterials; (2) Development of synergetic advantages of natural minerals; (3) Novel approaches for functional composites preparation.

<b>2. Undergraduate Programs Introduction</b><br>
<b>2.1 Chemical Engineering and Technology </b> <br>
This program aims to cultivate advanced application-type specialized personnel who acquired basic trainings for chemical engineers. Graduates should have basic theories and solid practical abilities in the fields of chemical engineering and technology, and can engage in professions such as engineering design, technology development, process implementation and management, and scientific research.
<br><br>

<b>2.2 Environmental Engineering </b><br>
Environmental Engineering aims to cultivate specialized practical talents with the  knowledge of urban water, gas, sound, solid waste and other pollution controlling, water supply and drainage engineering, pollution controlling engineering, water resources protection and other aspects of knowledge. The graduates are supposed to be qualified to work in environmental engineering related government departments such as planning departments, environmental protection departments, designing institutes, industrial and mining enterprises, and scientific research institutes, doing the work as planning, designing, management, development and research.<br><br>

<b>2.3 3 Pharmaceutical Engineering</b><br>
Pharmaceutical Engineering involves many interrelated disciplines (chemistry, pharmacy, biology, chemical engineering, etc.). The undergraduate program aims to train innovative and socially responsible engineers with the requisite skills for the production of pharmaceuticals and its related products and to engage in the technology development, technology & engineering design, production, management and service work in the pharmaceutical and related fields.<br><br>
