            	<b>1. Faculty Introduction</b>
                <br>
The faculty of Faculty of electronic and information, dating back to the faculty electrical and electronic engineering, was established in July 2015 after professional optimization and adjustment of the parts of original faculty of electrical and electronic engineering and faculty of computer engineering.
The faculty consists of three departments (electronic information engineering department, electronic Science department and communication engineering department) and one electrical and electronic teaching experiment center. There are three specialties: electronic information engineering, electronic science and technology and communication engineering, and among them, electronic information engineering is a pilot program of national excellent engineer(software) education and training program, and Communication engineering is the first batch of Jiangsu Province excellent engineer(software) education and training program. 
</br>

There are 39 staffs in the Faculty including 6 professors, 8 associate professors and 5 supervisors of masters, among whom 37 have received master and / or Ph.D. degrees, 4 candidates for ‘Huaian 533 Excellent Talents Project’ and 1 Huai'an City labor model. In the past several years, the faculty members have published over 130 papers, including 46 listed in the index of SCI, EI and ISTP, and finished 25 scientific research projects of national, provincial and municipal levels with 1 National science foundation and 3 spark programs. And 7 national invention patents and utility model patents are authorized.<br>

The Faculty has advanced teaching and research facilities, covers an experimental area of more than 2,400 square meters and its equipments worth more than 10 million yuan RMB. It has established Electrical and electronic teaching experiment center, Key laboratory of optoelectronic technology Huai'an city, laser-induced fluorescence laboratory. And Electric and electronic experimental teaching center is the provincial Experiment Teaching Demonstration Center, including more than 20 Branch Lab, such as "electrician", "high-frequency electronic circuit", "innovation" and so on. The Faculty attach great importance to the construction of Practice Base, including more than 20 training base are established in Nanjing, Suzhou and Huai'an.<br><br> 

<b>2. Undergraduate Programs Introduction</b><br>
<b>2.1 Electronic and Information Engineering </b> <br>
The main subject is Information and Communication Engineering. Students systematically study the following courses: mathematical, circuit, computer, signal and system, communication principle, digital signal processing, electromagnetic field and electromagnetic wave, optical fiber communication, wireless communication, etc. To meet the needs of developing of modern communication, two new specialties are offered i.e. network communication and wireless communication, as well as the following courses: management, humane studies and various experimental courses. To improve the students' practical ability，some practical teaching courses are set up, including the curriculum design, the skills training, the cognition practice about communication system, the communication system synthesis practice, the production practice, the graduation design and so on.<br><br>

<b>2.2 Electronic Science and Technology </b><br>
