            	<b>1. Faculty Introduction</b>
                <br>
The Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, growing out of the department of computing science, was first established in 2001, and then renamed in 2009. Currently the faculty has a total number of 82 teaching and administrative staff, including 4 professors, 23 associate professors, 18 teachers with Doctor’s Degree. It comprises the Department of the Mathematics Teaching, the Mathematics Teaching, the Applied Mathematics, and the Applied Physics and a Mathematics & Physics Experiment Education center which are responsible for the general education of Mathematics and Physics courses within the Huaiyin Institute of Technology. Moreover, it offers two undergraduate programs, the major of information and computation science and the major of applied physics. It also has a Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of physics.</br>

The Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, an annual intake of about 80 students from all over the country, has about 350 students. Many of them have been Degreeed municipal, provincial and national prizes in many subjects’ competitions, such as the Mathematics Contest in Modeling and the Physical Innovation Contest. The experiences from these contests further arouse their interest in mathematics. They pay more attention to its application as well as learning the theories.<br>

The faculty enjoys a great scientific research atmosphere, and the staff pays special attentions to the five research fields, such as the Dynamical System, Uncertainty Mathematics, Graph Theory, Condensed Matter Physics, Photoelectric Technology. In recent years our research fellows have made great achievements in teaching & researching and a good demonstration effect.

<b>2. Undergraduate Programs Introduction</b><br>
<b>2.1 Information and Computing Science</b> <br>
The Information and computing science, a cross subject, is based on the background of information field, and combines Mathematics with Computer Information Management. The students of this specialty are required to have good mathematics foundation, utilize computer skillfully, and have the abilities to solve practical problems in the field of Information and Computer Science<br><br>

<b>2.2 Applied Physics</b><br>
This program aims at training students to adapt to the socialist modernization construction and local economic and social development needs. We have tailored the projects to equip the students with all-round development, the innovative entrepreneurship and social responsibilities. The students are required to master the basic theories of physics and experimental skills and knowledge in the field of photoelectric technology, have the ability to apply the basic theories of physics and optoelectronic technology knowledge and experimental skills to the scientific research and engineering technology. They are required to serve as the senior specialized talents in research, teaching, development and application of new technology and technology management work in the applied physics, electronic information and photoelectric technology.<br><br>
